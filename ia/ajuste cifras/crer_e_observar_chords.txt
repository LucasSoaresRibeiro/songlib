     D                             A            D
When we walk with the Lord in the light of His Word
        G        D          A
What a glory He sheds on our way 
       D    
While we do His good will
       A           D            G              D     A   D
He abides with us still and with all who will trust and obey

 A         D               B       Em       
Trust and obey for there's no other way 
      A/C#      D/F#         G     A   D Bm 
To be happy in Jesus but to trust and obey


        D                   A             D
But we never can prove the delights of His Love
     G          D       A
Until all on the altar we lay
        D                       A         D
For the favor He shows; for the joy He bestows
         G           D        A    D
Are for them who will trust and obey

[Chorus]

Then in fellowship sweet we will sit at His Feet
          G           D         A
Or we'll walk by His Side in the way
       D                         A          D
What He says we will do; where He sends we will go
       G          D     A   D
Never fear only trust and obey
